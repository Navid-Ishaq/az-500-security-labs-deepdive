This flow outlines each decision and action the team took — from VM setup to cleanup — all while learning how tagging improves clarity and control in Azure.

## 🏁 Step 1: Entering the Lab with Curiosity

**Ayesha**, the team lead at **SkyBridgeTech**, handed the lab brief to **Omar** and **Sofia**, who were early in their Azure journeys.

> “Tagging isn’t just for neat freaks,” she smiled. “It’s for professionals who care about traceability.”

The goal? Set up a virtual machine and learn to **organize it with tags** — a simple, powerful tool that often goes overlooked.

---

## 🖥️ Step 2: Creating the Virtual Machine

Omar and Sofia navigated to the **Azure Portal**. They launched a **Windows Server 2019 VM**, selected the affordable **B1s size**, and used default security options. Omar named the resource group `rg-skybridge-omar` to keep things clean and clear.

Sofia nodded,

> “Feels like I’m building a puzzle... but this time, I know where the edge pieces are.”

---

## 🏷️ Step 3: Applying the Tag

Now came the real magic — the **tagging step**.

They clicked on the VM, went to **Settings > Tags**, and entered:

* **Name:** `Department`
* **Value:** `IT`

> “That’s it?” Sofia asked.
> “Yep,” said Omar. “And that little detail will save us hours someday.”

**Tags**, though small, create massive value: they allow teams to track ownership, group resources, and **bring clarity to chaos**.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Filtering with a Purpose

Next, the team applied a filter in the **Resource Group** view:

* Filter by **Tag: Department = IT**

Only the tagged VM showed up.

Ayesha watched them discover it firsthand.

> “This is like searching for labeled luggage at baggage claim,” she said.
> “And finding exactly what’s yours — in seconds.”

This simple filter showed **the power of intentional organization** in cloud environments.

---

## 🧼 Step 5: Clean-Up with Confidence

Because their tagged resources were clearly visible, Sofia confidently deleted everything — without fear of breaking shared environments.

It was a **clean close to a clean lab**.

> “That felt good,” she said. “I knew exactly what I was removing.”

It wasn’t just about deletion — it was about **trust in the process**.

---

## 🤔 Step 6: Why It All Matters

What started as “just a VM lab” turned into a **lesson in sustainable cloud practices**.

In real-world settings:

* Tags support **governance**
* They assist with **cost tracking**
* They make cloud resources **auditable and accountable**

Omar reflected,

> “It’s like giving every cloud resource a name tag at a big conference — no one gets lost.”

---

## 💬 Step 7: Team Reflection

Later that day, during their team huddle, Ayesha asked:

> “What’s one word to describe tagging now?”

**Sofia:** “Control.”
**Omar:** “Clarity.”
**Ayesha:** “Consistency.”

The team had learned more than just tagging — they had practiced **intentional cloud management**.

---

## 🔄 Step 8: From Concept to Confidence

By the end of the session, the group wasn’t just checking boxes — they were thinking like cloud engineers.

They’d gone from:

* Guessing ➡️ Filtering
* Clicking ➡️ Understanding
* Building ➡️ Managing

And it all started with a **simple label**.
